/**
 * @description Arithmetic objects and routines. This is a port of the
 * Verificatum Mix-Net (VMN) which introduces abstractions that
 * facilitates the implementation of generalized cryptographic
 * primitives and protocols.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * More precisely, the implementations of generalized primitives and
 * protocols is syntactically identical to their original versions,
 * e.g., the complex code found in other libraries for handling lists
 * of ciphertexts is completely eliminated. This gives less error
 * prone code, a smaller code base, and the code is easier to verify.
