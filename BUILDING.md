# Building the Library

This library requires `emacs` to indent generated files. You can edit
`tools/compilejs` to remove this dependency and the indentation, or
plug in another tool for this purpose.

This software can built using:

        make <target>

using one of:

| Target      | Description
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------
| [all]       | All the below.
| vjsc        | Library in standard form.
| min-vjsc    | Library without comments and redundant newlines.
| api-vjsc    | API for the library including browsable source code.
| bench-vjsc  | HTML files for running benchmarks in a browser.

The resulting libraries ends up in `js/` and are named using the
prefix `vjsc-`, e.g., `vjsc-<VERSION>.js`. The API ends up in
`api-vjsc` and the benchmark ends up in `bench-vjsc`. Tar-balls are
also built.


## Optional Classes and Groups

The library can be built to include different subsets of standard
groups, multiplicative groups, fixed basis exponentiations in
multiplicative groups, and elliptic curve groups. Consult the
`Makefile` for more information.


## Check Library

The unit tests for the standard and minimized forms are run using:

        make check

or

        make checkminimized

This runs the test suite for the standard wordsize. You can also run
all tests for *all* valid wordsizes using
`./tools/check_wordsizes`. This is a great way to ensure that
algorithms are sound, since it exposes corner cases related to word
boundaries.


## Static Analysis and Code Coverage

You can run some syntatical checking and static analysis of the code
using `jshint` or `eslint` with:

        make jshint

or

        make eslint

or you can generate a unified analysis using

        make analysis

but all of this obviously requires that JSHint and/or ESLint are
installed. There are rulesets in `tools/staticanalysis/<TOOL>`, but
there are also a few suppressions in the code. You can grep for them
using the patterns `jshint` and `eslint`.


## Remark On Building Tools

JavaScript developers may find the use of macros and shell script to
generate code surprising. This is a deliberate decision and not a
failure to consider various tools and frameworks available.

Note that the code to be tested and audited in a real application is
the *generated* code that is actually executed. Tracking changes in it
can be done using various tools, e.g., using versioning tools or
diff/grep, so in fact there is a strict gain in security in our
approach and we are willing to pay a high price for correctness and
security.

We need our code to be as clean as possible, with no dependencies, and
with as strong encapsulation as possible. Thus, we have opted on
generating a *single* file. It would be horrible to develop software
in a single file of course, so we needed a mechanism for including
files. We also needed users to be able to remove modules, but in a way
that results in a static single file. There was no proper include
system for JavaScript at the time this was implemented, so we built
a minimal one using M4.

We are aware that particular "frameworks" have inclusion and packaging
mechanisms. We deliberately choose to not use them because they add
dependencies are are part of an ever changing landscape of what we
consider to be hacks.

Using constants instead of variables is important for speed, but the
code must be readable. In recent versions of JavaScript there is
"const" and "let". We have opted for M4 macros instead that are
replaced by the literal constants.

There are clearly pros and cons of our approach, and we are not
entirely happy with it. We welcome a constructive discussion with
readers that have ideas on how to improve or replace our approach
entirely as long as the overall goal stays the same.
